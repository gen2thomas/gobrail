## Example "type2_2turnout_lightbarrier_3keys"

#### General
This operates 2 turnouts controlled by an light barrier and an key. Two boards are required, a basic "Type 2" board and an additional breadboard for wiring the keys. The plan connects the "Turnout1" to the light barrier "K1rt". The light barrier is internal treated as toggle button. "Turnout2" is connected to a button "K2gn" in toggle mode. This means the turnouts will change the position at each press of the button or passing the light barrier.
> This is an very basic schematic with 3 IR LED's as transmitter and an photo transistor as optical receiver. This means the circuit is sensitive for component tolerances. A multimeter and some basic knowledge of electrical circuits will be needed possibly when it does not work.

#### Mods
Please refer "type2_2turnout_4keys" example for some possible modifications, because this circuit and plan is mostly the same.
